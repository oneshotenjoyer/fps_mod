# FPS Display Mod

A simple FPS display - made by modguy07 (me), with a bit of help from the Fabric Modding discord.

Shout out to 𝓣𝓱𝓮·𝓦𝓱𝔂·𝓔𝓿𝓮𝓷·𝓗𝓸𝔀 for helping me with all sorts of weird crap I ran into. Actual goat.

// TODO:
- Config file for the one little bit of config (which corner the display goes in)
- Support for other mod loaders (may never happen)
